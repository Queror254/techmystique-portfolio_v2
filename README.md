## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This project is built with modern web technologies but without a complex build setup, making it easy to run locally.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A local web server. The easiest way is to use a VS Code extension like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or run `python -m http.server` from the project directory.

### Local Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Queror254/interactive-terminal-portfolio.git
    cd interactive-terminal-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Set up the Gemini API Key (Optional):**
    The `ask` command requires a Google Gemini API key. This project is configured to use an environment variable `API_KEY`. For local development in a static setup, you can temporarily modify `components/output/AskOutput.tsx`:

    - Find the line: `const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });`
    - Replace `process.env.API_KEY` with your actual API key string for testing.
    - **Important**: Do not commit your API key to your repository!

3.  **Run the application:**
    - If using VS Code's Live Server, right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
    - If using Python, run `python -m http.server` and open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

    - Change the values for `YOUR_NAME`, `YOUR_HEADLINE`, `YOUR_EMAIL`, `PROFILE_IMAGE_URL`, and `SOCIAL_LINKS`.

2.  **Add Your Projects and Skills**:

    - In the same file (`constants.tsx`), edit the `PROJECTS` and `SKILLS` arrays to reflect your own work and expertise.
    - For projects, make sure to update the `caseStudy` with your own detailed write-up.

3.  **Customize Themes**:
    - Open `index.html`.
